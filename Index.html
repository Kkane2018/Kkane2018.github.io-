<P> Hi! This is my website where I will talk about myself.
    So far since I have been at school,I have joined the MBS corps,
    the residence hall council and a marketing club. I love school so far, and I can't wait to
    see what my future brings me.
    On the following pages on this website I talk about my pets,
    my family and my favorite foods. Click the links below to be taken to the following pages, where
    you learn about me! Hope you enjoy!</P>
