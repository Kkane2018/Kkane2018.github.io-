 <H1>My Pets</H1>

  I have a dog named Bella. She is about 7 years old now

  I have a cat named Jollie. We rescused him from a shelter.
  So his exact age isnt known but he is around 9 years old now.

  My dad also has a tank of fish. He has angle fish and several
  other kids in the same tank.


  This is a picture of both my cat and Dog.
  They love to play with each other and chase each other around
   inside my house as well as outside.
